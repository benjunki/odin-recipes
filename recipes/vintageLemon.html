            <h3>In the 1800's this is how people made lemonadeâ€”you can do it too! It's not that difficult, and tastes wonderful!</h3>
            <p>Ingredients: 
                <ul>
                    <li>5 lemons</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 cups of white sugar</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 quarts water</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Steps:
                <ol>
                    <li>Peel the rinds from the 5 lemons and cut them into 1/2 inch slices. Set the lemons aside.</li>
                    <li>Place the rinds in a bowl and sprinkle the sugar over them. Let this stand for about one hour, so that the sugar begins to soak up the oils from the lemons.</li>
                    <li>Bring water to a boil in a covered saucepan and then pour the hot water over the sugared lemon rinds. Allow this mixture to cool for 20 minutes and then remove the rinds.</li>
                    <li>Squeeze the lemons into another bowl. Pour the juice through a strainer into the sugar mixture. Stir well, pour into pitcher and pop it in the fridge! Serve with ice cubes.</li>
                </ol>
